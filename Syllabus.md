Course Overview
Design Thinking is about defining the right work, and agile is about doing the work right. Agile culture is about clarity of purpose and that all work directly supports the overall value delivered to markets and customers. This course will be a balance of understanding key principles, values, culture/behaviors, and practices of Agile and applying them through learning by doing with peers on an actual problem to create a prioritized backlog of work.

Weekly Course Goals
I am a firm believer that class time should be working time, based on the "upside down teaching" model where typical lectures are provided before the class, and class time is used for collaboration. Each three hour session will be a mixture of class discussion based on pre-class content that should be reviewed; spending individual time with each team to discuss key issues facing a team to meet the goal of the course and 30 minutes discussion for questions and answers by the whole class. 

So each week, there will be:
• pre class content to be consumed and understood
• class discussion and team working time to tackle key progress and any blockers that reduce velocity

Use of Blackboard, Mural, Git Hub and Zen Hub
We live in a digital world. While the use of actual PostIt Notes® on physical surfaces are ok, it is not easily sharable or iterated upon by people who are not present in the physical space. A key tenant of Agile is all work is visible to all team members. For this reason, we will be using Mural, GitHub and ZenHub, key industry tools used by highly effective teams. There will be no training for these tools as they are easy to use and there are many online resources to learn specifics. I expect each student to spend time outside class learning how to use these tools.
