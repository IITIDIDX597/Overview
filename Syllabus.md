### Class Syllabus

###### Course Overview

Design Thinking is about defining the right work, and agile is about doing the work right. Agile culture is about clarity of purpose and that all work directly supports the overall value delivered to markets and customers. This course will be a balance of understanding key principles, values, culture/behaviors, and practices of Agile and applying them through learning by doing with peers on an actual problem to create a prioritized backlog of work.


###### Learning Objectives

• clearly understand how agile activates design thinking

• learn key concepts and terminologies and to use them in conversations and actual work 

• why active collaboration and transparency can increase communications and work output

• understand specific agile practices, and how they work with established design thinking practices

• understand how to break down a design problem into a backlog of work that can be delivered to market

• learn how to use mural for ideation and iteration

• learn how to use GitHub and ZenHub to create repositories, input stories and manage a weekly kanban


###### Learning Outcomes

• to be able to break down a design thinking project into a backlog of work that can be tackled by the student or a larger team

• to be able to use agile practices on design projects to decrease the delta between concept and execution

• to be motivated to use agile after the course is completed in other IIT/ID classes or at work

• to be able to integrate better with a team that uses agile and lean practices on projects


###### Weekly Course Goals

I am a firm believer that class time should be working time, based on the "upside down teaching" model where typical lectures are provided before the class, and class time is used for collaboration. Each three hour session will be a mixture of class discussion based on pre-class content that should be reviewed; spending individual time with each team to discuss key issues facing a team to meet the goal of the course and 30 minutes to reflect on the previous week's work and answer questions from the class. 


So each week, there will be:


• pre class content to be consumed and understood

• class discussion and team working time to tackle key progress and any blockers that reduce velocity


###### Week by Week Themes

Each week there will be four pre-class activities that each student/team will need to do by the MONDAY before the class meeting:

• Review online written content

• Review videos

• Review week presentation

• To Do Exercise(s)

###### Schedule

Week 1 : October 18 : Situational Awareness

Week 2 : October 25  : Project statement, hill statements; definitions

Week 3 : November 01 : Creation of story statements to epics

Week 4 : November 08 : Group general backlog of stories, called “issues” in GitHub

Week 5 : November 15 : Write acceptance criteria for key stories

Outside of Class : Visit a company doing design thinking and agile integration

NO CLASS ON NOVEMBER 22 - THANKSGIVING

Week 6 : November 29 : Size each of the stories in the project backlog

Outside of Class : Individual Dry run of presentations

Finals Week : December 06 : Presentation of work to a guest panel


###### Use of Blackboard, Mural, Git Hub and Zen Hub

We live in a digital world. While the use of actual PostIt Notes® on physical surfaces are ok, it is not easily sharable or iterated upon by people who are not present in the physical space. A key tenant of Agile is all work is visible to all team members. For this reason, we will be using Mural, GitHub and ZenHub, key industry tools used by highly effective teams. There will be no training for these tools as they are easy to use and there are many online resources to learn specifics. I expect each student to spend time outside class learning how to use these tools.

Blackboard : Syllabus and weekly pre-class handouts

Mural : Ideation Exercises and Reflections

Slack : Real time communication on a variety of issues

GitHub : Team repository of stories and backlog of work to be updated daily

ZenHub : Team Kanban to be updated daily


All of these platforms are instrumented meaning that everytime a student does something, the instructor gets a notification of what was done. This is the new world of digital platforms so please do not freak out ;-). This is done to understand the velocity of a team and that the instructor knows what work has been done so class time is more about collaborating to improve the work.

###### Format & Grading

As graduate students, I expect each of you to be professional, motivated and follow-through on all commitments to make this course a success. 

Completion of weekly tasks - 50%
Use of Blackboard, Mural Git Hub, Zenhub - 10%
Innovative uses of digital tools to meet team goals - 10%
Class Participation - 30%

*One big thing I have seen in classes are students coming late into class. This will not be acceptable and ruins the class for everyone else. You are expected to show up a few minutes BEFORE class starts. Two late incidents without warning will result in a reduction in one letter grade.*

A key tenant of Agile is all work is visible to all team members. For this reason, I have secured free student accounts for Mural, GitHub and ZenHub which are key industry tools used by highly effective teams.

I expect each student to spend time outside class learning how to use these tools and have collected key videos to help you in this effort.<br>
