Typical Structure of Class:
I am a firm believer that class time should be working time, so each three hour session will be a mixture of class discussion based on pre-class content that should be reviewed; spending individual time with each team to discuss key issues facing a team to meet the goal of the course and 30 minutes discussion for questions and answers by the whole class.

- 30 minute discussion of pre class content
- 15 minute individual team working sessions (8 teams) : 2 hours
- 30 minutes Q&A time

First class
Please remember that your first class should explicitly cover the course objectives and your approach to grading. 90% of student/faculty frustrations come from misunderstood objectives and grading rubrics.
